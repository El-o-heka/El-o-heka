                       "POLYNOMIAL\|/POWER RULE" 
DERIVATIVE OF THE FUNCTION f(x)=x³+2x³+4
 USE THE POWER RULE OF THE DIFFERENTIATION WHICH STATES 
THAT THE DERIVATIVE OF A POLYNOMIAL FUNCTION OF THE FORM 
X"IS GIVEN BY n•xn-1
  USING THIS RULE WE CAN FIND THE DERIVATIVE OF EACH TERM IN THE FUNCTION f(x)AS FOLLOWS 
d/dx(x³)=3x²
d/dx(2x²)=4x
d/dx(-3x)=-3
d/dx(4)=0
 ADDING THESE DERIVATIVES TOGETHER,WE GET THE DERIVATIVE OF THE FUNCTION f(x)f¹(x)=3x²+4x-3
