given equation {Y=3} 
The equation is already in the slope intercept form (y=mx+b)
,where m is the slope & b is the[Y-intercept]comparing the given equation with the slope intercept form,we can see that the slope intercept 
(m=0)and the Y-intercept(b=3)
the slope of the line is(0)
 which means that the line is horizontal.
 The Y-intercept of the line is 3, which means that the line crosses the y-axis at the point 
(0,3) graph the line by plotting the Y-intercept(0,3)
and using the slope(m=0)
to find other points of the line.
 since the slope is(0),any change in(X) will not Result in a change in(Y).
Therefore,the line Will be a  horizontal line passing through the point(0,3).
