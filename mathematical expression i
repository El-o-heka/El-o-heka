                       "MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION i"
   EXAMPLE? 
     ET'SSAY THE PROBLEM IS TO FIND THE ROOT OF THE QUADRATIC EQUATION 
  X²+2X-3=0
 **ANALYZE THE PROBLEM**
 THIS IS A QUADRATIC EQUATION AND WE N3ED TO FIND THE VALUES OF X
THAT MAKE THE EQUATIONS TRUE 
  **DEVELOPE A STRATEGY**
WE CAN USE THE QUADRATIC FORMULA TO SOLVE FOR THE ROOTS:
  X=-b±√b²-4ac/2a, WHERE a=1,b=2 & c=-3
 **SOLVE THE PROBLEM**
PLUGGING IN THE VALUES WE GET:
  x=-2±√2²-4•1•-3/2•1=-2±√16/2=-1±2
+
THEREFORE THE ROOTS ARE x=1 & x=-3
**VERIFY THE SOLUTION**
WE CAN CHECK THAT THESE VALUES INDEED SATISFY THE ORIGINAL EQUATION 
 **PRESENT THE SOLUTION**
  THE ROOT OF THE EQUATION
 x²+2x-3=0,Are x=1 & x=-3
