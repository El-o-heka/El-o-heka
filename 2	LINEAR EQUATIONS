                SYSTEM 2 EQUATIONS Y=2×+3 Y-3=2×
                          **SOLUTION**
  SOLVE SECOND EQUATION FOR X
 Y-3=2×  Y=2×+3
 SUBTRACT SECOND EQUATION 0=3 TRUE EQUATION 
 5KG OBJECT HORIZONTAL SURFACE 10-N FORCE APPLIED 
 TO OBJECT 5 SECOND KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS MASS OF
 M=50KG FORCE APPLIED ON OBJECT F=5⁵ FINAL VELOCITY 
 TO OBJECT F=10N TIME FORCED ON OBJECT T=5⁵ FINAL
 VELOCITY OF OBJECT (V) NEWTONS SECOND LAW OF MOTION
 STATES THAT FORCE ACTING ON OBJECT EQUAL TO THE PRODUCT 
 OF THE MASS AND ACCELERATION F=MA REARRANGING EQUATION TO
 SOLVE (A) A=F/M VELOCITY VALUES REARRANGING EQUATIONS 
 A=10N/50KG=0.02M/S²
 V=VA+⁵ WHICH IS OM/5
 V=0M/5+0.2M/5²×5S=1M/5
 FINAL VELOCITY OF MASS 1M/S
